<h1>Infinitely Scalable Tic Tac Toe</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I have created a web browser based two-player Tic Tac Toe game with a variable board size. A playable three by three Tic Tac Toe board is a classic programming project, but I wanted to make one that would work at any size (at least up into the several hundred by several hundred size).
This project includes the HTML file, CSS styles, and JavaScript code in separate files.
